# Parameters

CurrentModule = POD
```

## General

There are some general paremters that controls the behavior of the AMP:

* `log_level(default=0)`: verbosity of the algorihtm, set to `1` for turning on logging, `100` for detailed debugging mode

* `timeout(default=Inf)`: total time regulated for the solver in seconds

* `max_iter(default=999)`: total iteration allowed in the [`global_solve`](@ref)

* `rel_gap(default=1e-4)`: relative gap considered for optimality during [`global_solve`](@ref). Bounds are evaluated using ``\frac{UB-LB}{UB} 100 \times \%``

* `tol(default=1e-6)`: numerical tol used furing the process of [`global_solve`](@ref)

## Discretization-based parameters

* `disc_ratio(default=4)`: used during [`add_adpative_partition`](@ref) for measuring the radius of new partitioning relative to the active domain

* `disc_var_pick(default=0)`: controls algorithm/methods used for selecting variables for discretization, `0` is for max-cover, `1` is for minimum-vertex-cover. This parameter allows functional inputs.

* `disc_add_partition_method`: allows functional input on how new partitions should be constructed. This paremeter is not fully stable.

## Presolve Parameters

* `presolve_track_time(default=false)`: consier presolve time as the total time or not

* `presolve_bt(default=false)`: perform built-in bound tightening presolve procedure

* `presolve_max_iter(default=9999)`: maximum iteration allowed using presolve process

* `presolve_bt_min_bound_width(default=1e-3)`: independent numerical tol used in presolve for bound tightening procedure. Note that this procedure is more sensitive to the tol in here. Small tol is more likely to results in strange presolve behvaior.

* `presolve_bt_algo(default=1)`: method used to do built-in bound tightening, choose `1` for regular bounding tightening,  `2` for Tighten McCormick bound tightening.

* `presolve_bt_relax(default=false)`: whether to relax the bounding tightening MILP solved or not

* `presolve_bt_mip_time_limit(default=Inf)`: time limit used for invidiual MILP solved during bound tightening presolve
